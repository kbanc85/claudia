# Decision Log

Significant decisions and their rationale. The goal isn't to log everything—it's to remember why you chose a path when it matters later.

## Format

Each decision captures:
- **What** was decided
- **Why** this choice over alternatives
- **Who** made it / was involved
- **When** it was made
- **Context** that mattered at the time
