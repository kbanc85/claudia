# Inbox Processing Workflow

A systematic approach to processing email with Claudia's help.

## When to Process

- **Morning:** Quick scan for urgent items (10 min)
- **Midday or end of day:** Full processing session (20-30 min)
- **Not constantly:** Batch processing beats reactive checking

## The Processing Flow

### 1. Scan (2 min)

Quick look for:
- **Urgent:** Needs response in next few hours
- **Important:** From key relationships, time-sensitive topics
- **Can wait:** Everything else

### 2. Urgent First (5 min)

Handle truly urgent items:
- Quick replies you can do in <2 min
- Acknowledgments ("Got it, will review by EOD")
- Escalations that can't wait

### 3. Process Each Email (bulk of time)

For each non-urgent email, ask:

**1. Is there a commitment here?**
- I promised something → `context/commitments.md`
- They promised something → `context/waiting.md`

**2. Is there a decision or context update?**
- Update `people/[name].md` if new context about someone
- Note decisions in project files if applicable

**3. What's the next action?**
- Reply needed → Draft it or schedule time
- Action needed → Add to commitments
- Just FYI → Archive

**4. Does this email affect relationships?**
- New contact worth tracking → `people/[name].md`
- Existing relationship update → Update their file

### 4. Drafts for Review (safety)

When Claudia helps draft replies:
1. She drafts based on context
2. You review and edit
3. Explicit approval before sending

Never auto-send. Ever.

## What Claudia Does

With email integration, Claudia can:
- Pull recent emails for processing
- Check sender against `people/` for context
- Extract commitments and decisions
- Draft replies matching your voice
- Suggest follow-ups for stale threads

Claudia can't:
- Send without your approval
- Delete emails
- Make you feel bad about inbox size

## Processing Prompts

"Help me process my inbox"
→ Claudia will:
1. Check recent emails (if integration available)
2. For each: summarize, surface relationship context, identify commitments
3. Ask what action to take
4. Update files as you decide

"What needs attention in my email?"
→ Quick triage: urgent items, waiting responses, stale threads

"Draft a reply to [person/subject]"
→ Claudia drafts, you approve

## Inbox Health Indicators

You're doing well if:
- No email is more than 48 hours old without a response or decision
- Commitments from email are captured, not floating
- You process in batches, not constantly
- You're not anxious about your inbox

Don't aim for inbox zero—aim for inbox calm.
