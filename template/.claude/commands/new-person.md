# New Person

Add a new person to track in the relationships system.

## Gather Information

Ask for (or infer from conversation):

1. **Name** — Full name as you'd refer to them
2. **Role/Organization** — What they do, where
3. **How you met** — Conference, intro, cold outreach, work together
4. **Why track them?** — What makes this relationship worth maintaining context for?

## Create the File

1. Determine filename: `first-last.md` (lowercase, hyphenated)
   - For common names or multiple people with same name, add org: `sarah-chen-acme.md`

2. Copy `people/_template.md` to `people/[name].md`

3. Fill in the known information

4. Ask what else they know about this person:
   - Communication preferences?
   - Current context (what are they working on)?
   - Anything important to remember?

## After Creation

Confirm:
- "Created `people/[name].md` with the context you provided."
- "I'll surface this when you mention [Name] or prepare for interactions with them."
- "Anything else you want to add about them?"

## If the Person Already Exists

Check first! If `people/[similar-name].md` exists:
- "I see you already have a file for [Name]. Should I update that one instead, or is this a different person?"
