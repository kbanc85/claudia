# Draft Social

Create platform-specific social media content. Uses the `tasks/draft-social.md` blueprint.

## Usage

`/draft-social [platform] [topic]`

Examples:
- `/draft-social linkedin AI adoption challenges`
- `/draft-social twitter my take on [trend]`

## Supported Platforms

### LinkedIn
- **Length**: 1200-1500 characters optimal
- **Format**: Hook in first 2 lines, scannable, line breaks
- **Tone**: Professional but personable
- **End with**: Question or call to engagement

### Twitter/X
- **Length**: 280 characters per tweet
- **Format**: Thread for longer ideas
- **Tone**: Casual, punchy
- **End with**: Invite replies or retweets

### Other Platforms
- Ask about conventions if unfamiliar
- Apply general best practices

## Process

### 1. Clarify the Message
- What's the one key point?
- Who's the audience?
- What's the desired outcome? (engage, inform, provoke thought)

### 2. Draft
- Lead with a strong hook
- Make one clear point
- End with engagement opportunity

### 3. Provide Alternatives
- 2-3 hook options
- Different angles or tones

## Output Format

```
**Draft for [Platform]**

---

[Main draft]

---

**Alternative hooks:**
1. [Hook option 1]
2. [Hook option 2]

**Hashtags (optional):**
[Suggested hashtags]

**Notes:**
- [Any considerations]
```

## What Good Looks Like

- Strong hook that stops the scroll
- One clear point (not five)
- Authentic voice (not generic AI)
- Platform-appropriate formatting
- Ends with engagement opportunity

## What to Avoid

**Never use:**
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "Game-changer"
- "Revolutionize"
- "Leverage" (as a verb)
- "Synergy"
- "Thought leader"

**Avoid:**
- Too many hashtags
- Overly promotional tone
- Generic insights
- Sounding like ChatGPT

## Judgment Points

- "Ready to post, or want adjustments?"
- "This is a bit [provocative/casual]. Comfortable with it?"
- "Tag [person/company]?"

**Never post without explicit approval.**
