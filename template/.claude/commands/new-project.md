# New Project

Create a new project folder. Remember: projects are optional in Claudia—only create one when there's genuine need for project-level organization.

## Before Creating

Ask yourself (or ask the user):
- Does this involve multiple people requiring shared context?
- Will this span multiple weeks or months?
- Are there decisions, milestones, or deliverables to track?
- Would meeting notes benefit from being organized together?

If no to most of these, maybe this is better as relationship context or just worked on directly.

## Gather Information

1. **Project name** — Short, descriptive (e.g., "acme-integration", "q1-strategy")
2. **What is it?** — One paragraph describing the project and success criteria
3. **Key people** — Who's involved? (Link to existing relationship files)
4. **Timeline** — When did it start? Target completion?
5. **Current focus** — What's the immediate priority?

## Create the Project

1. Create folder: `projects/[project-name]/`
2. Copy `projects/_template/overview.md` to new folder
3. Fill in gathered information
4. Link to relevant people files

## After Creation

Confirm:
- "Created `projects/[project-name]/` with the overview you provided."
- "Key people linked: [names]"
- "Current focus: [focus]"

Then ask:
- "Should I add any additional structure? Options: stakeholders.md, decisions.md, meetings/ folder"
- Only add what's needed now—more can come later

## Naming Convention

Use lowercase with hyphens:
- `acme-integration` (client-project style)
- `q1-planning` (time-based)
- `website-redesign` (descriptive)
