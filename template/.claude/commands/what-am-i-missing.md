# What Am I Missing

Surface risks, blind spots, overdue items, and cooling relationships across all your tracked context.

## What to Check

### 1. Overdue Commitments
From `context/commitments.md`:
- Anything past its deadline
- Anything due soon that looks at risk
- Patterns of missed deadlines

### 2. Overdue Waiting Items
From `context/waiting.md`:
- Items significantly overdue
- People who consistently deliver late
- Dependencies blocking your work

### 3. Cooling Relationships
From `people/`:
- Anyone not contacted in 60+ days who matters
- Relationships where last interaction was negative
- Key people you've been meaning to reach out to
- Anyone whose situation may have changed

### 4. Abandoned Commitments
- Promises made but never tracked
- Follow-ups promised but not done
- "I'll get back to you" without a date

### 5. Pattern Red Flags
From `context/patterns.md` and observations:
- Recurring issues not addressed
- Things that keep coming up
- Warnings from past reviews not acted on

### 6. Strategic Blind Spots
- Projects with no recent progress
- Goals mentioned but not tracked
- Opportunities not pursued
- Difficult conversations avoided

## Tone

- **Direct** — Don't soften real risks
- **Helpful, not judgmental** — Surface issues, don't criticize
- **Prioritized** — Most important first
- **Curious** — "Is this still a priority?" not "You forgot this"

## The Hard Questions

If appropriate, gently surface:
- "Are you avoiding anything?"
- "What would worry you if you stopped to think about it?"
- "What have you been meaning to do but haven't?"

## If Nothing Seems Off

"Looking across your commitments, waiting items, and relationships, nothing jumps out as urgent. But let me ask: Is there anything you've been avoiding, or anyone you've been meaning to reach out to?"
