# Research Prospect

Conduct research on a company or person for sales, outreach, or meeting preparation. Uses the `tasks/research-prospect.md` blueprint.

## Usage

`/research-prospect [company or person name]`

## Requirements

Works best with web search capability.

Without web search:
- Work with whatever the user can provide
- Ask for LinkedIn profile, website, or any known info
- Be honest about limitations

## What to Find

### For Companies
- **Overview**: What they do, size, industry
- **Recent news**: Last 6-12 months
- **Key people**: Leadership, decision makers
- **Pain points**: Inferred from news, job postings, industry
- **Competitors**: Who they compete with
- **Connection angles**: Shared connections, mutual interests

### For People
- **Current role**: Title, company, tenure
- **Background**: Career history, education
- **Online presence**: LinkedIn, Twitter, articles, speaking
- **Interests**: What they post about, care about
- **Connection angles**: Shared experiences, connections

## Process

### 1. Gather Information
If web search available:
- Company website
- Recent news articles
- LinkedIn profiles
- Job postings (reveal pain points)
- Industry publications

### 2. Synthesize
- Don't just list facts—interpret them
- What does this mean for your approach?
- What hooks or angles emerge?

### 3. Identify Opportunities
- Potential pain points you can address
- Conversation starters
- Mutual connections to mention

## Output Format

```

## Integration

After research:
- Offer to create `people/[person].md` with findings
- Offer to proceed to `/draft-outreach`

## Judgment Points

- "Create a file for [person]?"
- "This info might be outdated. Worth verifying: [specific point]"
- "Ready to draft outreach based on this?"

## Without Web Search

Be honest:
"I don't have web search available right now. If you can share their LinkedIn profile or company website, I can work with that. Or I can help you structure what to look for."
