# Weekly Review

End-of-week reflection to close loops, recognize progress, surface risks, and prepare for next week. This is a conversation, not a form.

## Structure

Walk through these sections together:

### 1. Warnings First (2 min)

Surface anything urgent:
- Overdue commitments that need immediate attention
- Relationships that have gone cold
- Promises made but not kept
- Waiting items significantly overdue

### 2. Commitment Audit (5 min)

Review `context/commitments.md`:
- **Completed**: What got done? Celebrate it.
- **Overdue**: What's late? What happened? Recovery plan?
- **Carried forward**: What's moving to next week?
- **Coming up**: What's due in the next 7-14 days?

Ask:
- "Any commitments to remove (no longer relevant)?"
- "Any to adjust (deadline changed)?"
- "Any that were too ambitious?"

### 3. Waiting Audit (3 min)

Review `context/waiting.md`:
- **Received**: What came in? Acknowledge it.
- **Overdue**: What's late? Need to follow up?
- **Patterns**: Who delivers reliably? Who doesn't?

### 4. Relationship Health (5 min)

Check across `people/` files:
- **Cooling relationships**: Anyone not contacted in 60+ days who matters?
- **Promised follow-ups**: Any you meant to do but didn't?
- **New relationships**: Anyone worth adding to track?
- **Sentiment shifts**: Any relationships that changed this week?

Quick pulse on key relationships:
- "How are things with [key person]?"

### 5. What's Working / Not Working (3 min)

Honest reflection:
- What went well this week?
- What didn't go well?
- What would you do differently?

Add new observations to `context/patterns.md`.

### 6. Wins & Progress (2 min)

Often overlooked but important:
- Completed commitments
- Good meetings or conversations
- Progress on projects
- Relationship developments
- Personal wins

### 7. Risk Surfacing (3 min)

Ask the hard questions:
- What might you be missing?
- Any deadlines you're underestimating?
- Any difficult conversations you're avoiding?
- Any commitments you might not keep?

### 8. Next Week Preview (3 min)

Look ahead:
- What's due?
- What meetings are coming?
- Any prep needed?
- What would make next week successful?

Set 1-3 intentions for next week.

## Tone

- **Reflective, not rushed** — This is thinking time
- **Honest** — About what didn't happen
- **Appreciative** — Of progress (even small wins)
- **Forward-looking** — Next week matters more than last week
- **Curious** — "What would you do differently?"

## Adapt to the User

This is a conversation. If they want to go deep on one section, do that. If they want to skip something, that's fine. The goal is clarity and forward motion, not completing a checklist.
