# Follow-Up Draft

Draft a post-meeting thank-you or summary email. Uses the `tasks/follow-up-draft.md` blueprint.

## Usage

`/follow-up-draft [person]` — after a meeting or conversation

## What to Include

### 1. Genuine Appreciation
- Thank them for their time
- Reference something specific from the conversation
- Not generic "thanks for meeting"

### 2. Key Takeaways
- Brief recap of main points (3-5 bullets max)
- What was decided or agreed
- Not a transcript—highlights only

### 3. Next Steps
Clearly state:
- What you will do (with timeline)
- What they will do (if applicable)
- When you'll connect again

### 4. Forward-Looking Close
- Express appropriate enthusiasm
- Leave door open for follow-up
- Warm sign-off

## Process

### 1. Gather Context
- Check `people/[person].md` for communication preferences
- Reference meeting notes if available
- Check `context/commitments.md` for new items

### 2. Match Relationship
- First meeting: More formal, comprehensive
- Ongoing relationship: Can be briefer
- Close relationship: More casual, personal

### 3. Draft

Keep it under 200 words unless comprehensive summary requested.

## Output Format

```
**Follow-Up Draft**

To: [recipient]
Subject: [Specific subject, not "Following up"]

---

[Draft email content]

---

**Notes:**
- This commits you to: [any promises in the email]
- Attachments to include: [if any]
- Tone: [description]
```

## Subject Line Guidelines

**Good:**
- "Re: AI Implementation Discussion — Next Steps"
- "Great connecting today — Summary and actions"
- "[Specific topic] — Following our conversation"

**Bad:**
- "Following up"
- "Great meeting!"
- "Quick note"

## Timing

- Same-day is best
- Next morning is fine
- More than 48 hours feels late

## Judgment Points

- "Ready to send?"
- "I'm committing to [X]. Correct?"
- "Should I attach [materials discussed]?"
