# Draft Outreach

Draft cold email or message for sales or networking outreach. Uses the `tasks/draft-outreach.md` blueprint.

## Usage

`/draft-outreach [prospect name/company]`

## Process

### 1. Gather Context
- Who is the target?
- What's your goal? (meeting, introduction, partnership)
- What's relevant about them?
- Any research done? (use `/research-prospect` first if needed)

### 2. Find the Hook
What makes this relevant to THEM:
- Recent news or achievement
- Shared connection or experience
- Problem you know they have
- Mutual interest

### 3. Draft the Email

Structure:
1. **Subject line** — Specific, not salesy
2. **Opening** — About THEM, not you
3. **Value** — Why this is worth their time (2-3 sentences)
4. **Credibility** — Brief proof you're worth talking to
5. **Ask** — Clear, low-friction request
6. **Sign-off** — Professional, not desperate

## Email Principles

**Length**: Under 150 words
**Ask**: Make it easy to say yes (15-min call, not hour meeting)
**Tone**: Confident, not desperate
**Focus**: Them, not you

## Output Format

```
**Outreach Draft**

To: [recipient]
Subject: [subject]

---

[Email content]

---

**Alternative subject lines:**
1. [Option 1]
2. [Option 2]

**Follow-up plan:**
- Day 3: [Brief follow-up approach]
- Day 7: [Second follow-up]

**Notes:**
- Personalization based on: [what research]
- Tone: [description]
```

## Subject Line Guidelines

**Good:**
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Question about [specific thing they do]"
- "Quick thought on [their recent post/news]"
- "[Specific topic] for [their company]"

**Bad:**
- "Quick question"
- "Can I pick your brain?"
- "Partnership opportunity"
- "Touching base"
- Anything that sounds like a template

## What to Avoid

- "Hope this finds you well"
- "I know you're busy, but..."
- "Just following up"
- Leading with your credentials
- Asking for too much too soon
- Sounding like a template
- Multiple asks in one email

## Integration

After sending (with approval):
- Track in `context/outreach.md`
- Set follow-up reminders

## Judgment Points

- "Ready to send?"
- "Track this for follow-up on [date]?"
- "Create a file for [person]?"

**Never send without explicit approval.**
