# Draft Article

Create long-form blog or article content.

## Usage

`/draft-article [topic]`

## Process

### 1. Clarify Scope
Ask:
- What's the main argument or thesis?
- Who's the audience?
- What length are you targeting?
- Any specific points to include?
- What's the desired outcome? (educate, persuade, establish expertise)

### 2. Research (if web search available)
- Current takes on this topic
- Recent news or developments
- Gaps in existing content
- Data or examples to reference

### 3. Outline First
Before writing, propose structure:

```
**Proposed Outline:**

1. **Hook/Opening** — [approach]
2. **The Problem/Context** — [what we're addressing]
3. **Main Argument** — [your thesis]
4. **Supporting Points**
   - [Point 1]
   - [Point 2]
   - [Point 3]
5. **Counterarguments** — [if relevant]
6. **Implications/So What** — [why it matters]
7. **Close** — [call to action or final thought]

Does this structure work?
```

### 4. Write
- Strong opening that hooks
- Clear sections with headers
- Concrete examples
- Authentic voice
- Actionable takeaways

### 5. Edit Pass
- Cut filler
- Strengthen weak sections
- Check flow
- Ensure one clear throughline
