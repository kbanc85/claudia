# Draft Reply

Draft an email response based on context from relationships and commitments.

## Usage

`/draft-reply` — then provide the email or context to respond to

## Process

### 1. Understand the Email
- Who is it from?
- What are they asking/saying?
- What's the tone?
- Any urgency?

### 2. Check Relationship Context
From `people/[sender].md`:
- Communication style preferences
- Relationship history
- Current context
- Any sensitivities

### 3. Check Commitments
From `context/commitments.md` and `context/waiting.md`:
- Anything relevant to this thread
- Promises made either direction
- Context from past interactions

### 4. Draft Response
Structure:
1. **Acknowledge** — What they said/asked
2. **Respond** — Answer their question or address their point
3. **Next step** — What happens next (if applicable)
4. **Close** — Appropriate sign-off

### 5. Match Tone
- Mirror their formality level
- Account for relationship depth
- Adjust for urgency

## Output Format

```
**Draft Reply**

To: [recipient]
Subject: Re: [subject]

---

[Draft email content]

---

**Notes:**
- Tone: [description]
- Anything I should know before sending?
```

## Judgment Points

**Always ask before sending:**
"Here's the draft. Ready to send, or want to adjust anything?"

**If commitment detected:**
"This response commits you to [X] by [date]. Track it?"

## Tone Guidelines

| Their Tone | Your Tone |
|------------|-----------|
| Formal | Professional, complete sentences |
| Casual | Friendly, can use contractions |
| Brief | Match brevity, don't over-explain |
| Detailed | Can be more thorough |
| Stressed | Efficient, reassuring |

## What Not to Do

- Don't send without explicit approval
- Don't make promises you haven't confirmed
- Don't be overly apologetic or sycophantic
- Don't use filler phrases ("Hope this finds you well...")
- Don't be robotic when warmth is warranted
