# Waiting On

Things other people have promised you. These are the open loops you're tracking.

## How Claudia Uses This

1. **Before meetings:** Surfaces what this person owes you
2. **Follow-up suggestions:** When something is overdue
3. **Pattern recognition:** Who delivers on time? Who needs reminders?

## Tracking What You're Owed

When someone makes a commitment to you, Claudia will ask:
- What did they promise?
- When did they say they'd deliver?
- Any context that might affect it?

This helps you follow up at the right time without nagging too early or forgetting entirely.
