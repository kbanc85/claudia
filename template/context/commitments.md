# Commitments

Things you've promised to deliver. Claudia tracks these and surfaces them when relevant.

## What Gets Tracked Here

**Track:** Explicit promises with deadlines or implied urgency
- "I'll send the proposal by Friday"
- "Let me get those numbers to you tomorrow"
- "I'll follow up after the meeting"

**Don't track:** Vague intentions without accountability
- "We should grab coffee sometime"
- "I'll think about that"
- "Maybe next quarter"

## Active Commitments

<!-- Format: checkbox, what, to whom, deadline, context -->

### This Week

- [ ] <!-- Example: Send proposal draft | Sarah Chen | Fri Jan 24 | Discussed in Monday call -->

### Coming Up

- [ ] <!-- Example: Review contract | Acme Corp team | Jan 31 | Waiting on their redlines first -->

### No Hard Deadline

- [ ] <!-- Example: Share AI resources | David Martinez | When available | He's interested but not urgent -->

## Recently Completed

## How Claudia Uses This

1. **Before meetings:** Surfaces commitments to that person
2. **Morning brief:** Highlights what's due today/this week
3. **Weekly review:** Audits all open commitments
4. **Pattern recognition:** Notices if you're overcommitting

## Adding Commitments

When you mention a commitment, Claudia will ask:
- What exactly are you committing to?
- Who is this for?
- When is it due?

Then it gets added here with a link to the relevant person file if applicable.
