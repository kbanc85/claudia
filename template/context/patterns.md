# Patterns

Observations about what works, what doesn't, and trends across your work. Claudia surfaces these gently when they're relevant.

## How This Works

Claudia notices things you might miss because you're in the middle of it:
- "This is the third time you've committed to a Friday deadline without checking your calendar"
- "You seem to get more done in morning meetings than afternoon ones"
- "Your communication with the Acme team has shifted—more tension lately"

Some patterns are worth writing down. Others just get mentioned and move on.

## Observations

## What Claudia Does With This

1. **Surfaces relevant patterns** during conversations
2. **Notices new patterns** as context accumulates
3. **Asks before adding** patterns to this file
4. **Uses patterns** to help you prepare and plan

This is meant to be a living document—patterns emerge, get validated, sometimes turn out to be wrong. That's fine.
