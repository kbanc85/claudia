# Task: Draft Social Content

---

## Trigger

- `/draft-social [platform] [topic]`
- "Write a LinkedIn post about..."
- "Draft a tweet on..."
- "Help me write something for [platform]"
- "Create a social post about..."

---

## Input

- **Type**: Topic or theme, optional source material
- **Format**: Verbal instruction, link, or key points
- **Source**: User's expertise, linked article, recent experience

---

## Context

- [x] **Content-related** — Reference `content/calendar.md` if exists
- [ ] **Person-specific** — If about/for someone specific

---

## Transformation

### 1. Extract
- **Key message** to communicate
- **Target audience** for this platform
- **Desired tone** (professional, casual, provocative, educational)
- **Source material** if provided (article, experience, data)

### 2. Organize
Apply platform-specific formatting:

**LinkedIn:**
- Hook in first 2 lines (before "see more")
- Scannable structure (line breaks, bullets)
- 1200-1500 characters optimal
- End with question or call to engagement

**Twitter/X:**
- 280 character limit per tweet
- Thread format for longer ideas
- Hook in first tweet
- Use line breaks for readability

**Other platforms:**
- Ask about conventions if unfamiliar
- Apply general best practices

### 3. Connect
- Reference past content on topic if tracked
- Consider audience relationship and what they care about

### 4. Synthesize
- Platform-ready draft
- Suggested hashtags (2-3 max, if relevant)
- Alternative hooks or angles (2-3 options)

## Decisions Required

| Decision Point | Options | Default Behavior |
|---------------|---------|------------------|
| Tone | Professional / Casual / Provocative / Educational | Match platform norms (LinkedIn = professional, X = casual) |
| Length | Short / Medium / Long | Platform optimal length |
| Call to action | Include / Omit | Include if topic warrants engagement |
| Hashtags | Include / Omit | Platform-specific (yes for LinkedIn, sparingly for X) |

---

## What Good Looks Like

- [ ] Matches platform conventions
- [ ] Has a strong hook/opening (first 2 lines matter most)
- [ ] Makes one clear point
- [ ] Feels authentic to user's voice (not generic AI)
- [ ] No corporate jargon or buzzword soup
- [ ] Appropriate length for platform
- [ ] Ends with engagement opportunity (question, call to action)

## Judgment Points

| Step | Why Approval Needed | How to Ask |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| Final draft | All external content | "Here's the draft. Ready to post?" |
| Tone check | Subjective | "This feels [X]. Want it more [Y]?" |
| Including mentions | Involves others | "Tag [person/company]?" |
| Provocative angle | Could be risky | "This take is a bit spicy. Comfortable with it?" |

## Notes

- Never post without explicit approval
- Avoid common AI-sounding phrases: "In today's fast-paced world...", "Let's dive in...", "Game-changer...", "Revolutionize..."
- Read the user's previous posts if available to match voice
- Offer 2-3 hook options when possible
- For threads, outline the full structure before writing each post
