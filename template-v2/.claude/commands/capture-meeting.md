## Judgment Points

Ask for confirmation on:
- Adding commitments (user must own promises)
- Adding waiting items (setting expectations)
- Updating sentiment in person files (subjective)
- Flagging concerns (interpretation required)
- File location (if ambiguous)

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Every action item has an owner
- [ ] Every commitment has a deadline (even approximate)
- [ ] Sentiment signals noted but not over-interpreted
- [ ] Summary is actionable, not just descriptive
- [ ] Related person files flagged for update
- [ ] No unexplained jargon or unclear references

## Tone

- Efficient — respect user's time
- Accurate — don't add or assume
- Helpful — surface the useful parts
- Action-oriented — what needs to happen next
