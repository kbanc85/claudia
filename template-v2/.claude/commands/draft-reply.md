## Response Types

### Information Request

- Your recommendation
- Easy to respond yes/no

### Thank You/Acknowledgment

- Forward-looking if appropriate

## Tone Matching

Consider:
- Their tone in the original message
- Your relationship history
- Cultural context
- The topic sensitivity

Options:
- **Formal:** "I appreciate your inquiry..."
- **Professional:** "Thanks for reaching out..."
- **Casual:** "Hey! Great question..."
- **Warm:** "So good to hear from you..."

## Length Calibration

Match the energy:
- Short message → Short response
- Detailed message → Address all points
- Simple question → Simple answer
- Complex topic → Thorough but organized

General rule: Shorter is usually better.

## Structure for Long Responses

If multiple points to address:
1. Opening acknowledgment
2. Point-by-point responses (numbered or bulleted)
3. Summary of any actions
4. Clear next step
5. Warm close

## Safety Note

I'll show you the draft first. I will NOT send anything without your explicit approval.

## Quick Options

"Want me to:
1. Draft as written
2. Adjust tone to [more formal / more casual]
3. Make it shorter
4. Add/remove something specific"
