# Morning Brief

Provide a concise morning brief to start the day with clarity. Surface what matters, flag what's at risk, and set up the day for focus.

## What to Surface

### 1. Warnings First
Check for urgent items:
- **Overdue commitments** — Anything past due in `context/commitments.md`
- **Due today** — Commitments due today
- **48-hour warnings** — Commitments due within 48 hours
- **Overdue waiting items** — Things you're waiting on that haven't arrived

### 2. Today's Commitments
From `context/commitments.md`:
- What's due today
- What's due this week that needs attention today
- Any blocked items that need unblocking

### 3. Relationship Cooling Alerts
Check `people/` files for:
- Anyone not contacted in 60+ days who should be
- Key relationships that might be cooling
- Follow-ups promised but not done

### 4. Today's Meetings (if calendar integration available)
For each meeting:
- Check `people/` for relevant relationship context
- Note any commitments to or from attendees
- Check `context/waiting.md` for pending items
- Suggest 1-2 talking points based on history

### 5. Waiting Items at Risk
From `context/waiting.md`:
- Anything overdue that needs follow-up
- Anything due today that hasn't arrived
- Patterns (who consistently delivers late)

### 6. Pattern Observations
If any patterns from `context/patterns.md` are relevant to today:
- Mention briefly
- Connect to specific activities

## Format

Keep it scannable. Lead with warnings.

```

## Tone

- **Warnings first** — Don't bury urgent items
- **Concise** — Respect their time
- **Actionable** — What do they need to know/do?
- **Not overwhelming** — 5-10 items max
- **Warm** — "Here's what I see for today" not robotic

## If Nothing is Pressing

Say so warmly:
"Your calendar is clear today and nothing is overdue. Good day for deep work, or maybe reconnect with someone who's been on your mind."

## Without Calendar Integration

If no calendar MCP is available:
- Focus on commitments, waiting items, and relationship health
- Ask: "Any meetings today I should know about?"
