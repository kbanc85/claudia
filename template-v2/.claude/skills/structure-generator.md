# Structure Generator Skill

**Triggers:** Invoked by the onboarding skill after archetype detection, or when user requests structure changes.

---

## Business Depth Levels

The structure generator supports three levels of business complexity, chosen during onboarding:

### Full System
Everything an organized professional needs for running their business:
- Pipeline tracking (active, prospecting, completed)
- Financial management (overview, expenses, invoicing, tax planning)
- Accountability tracking (commitments, overdue items)
- Templates library (client intake, meeting prep, milestone planning, etc.)
- Insights/patterns tracking
- Methodology documentation (if user has one)

### Starter System
Core tracking without overwhelming structure:
- Pipeline (active only)
- Finances (overview only)
- Basic templates (meeting capture)

### Minimal System
Just context and relationships, let structure grow organically:
- Context files (me, commitments, waiting, patterns, learnings)
- People folder

---

## Universal Business Modules

These modules are available to ALL archetypes based on `business_depth` setting:

### Full System Adds:

```
pipeline/
  active.md              ← Current engagements/deals
  prospecting.md         ← Sales funnel
  completed.md           ← Historical record

accountability/
  commitments.md         ← What I owe, what they owe me
  overdue.md             ← Escalation visibility

finances/
  overview.md            ← Revenue summary, capacity
  expenses.md            ← Expense tracking
  invoicing.md           ← Invoice log
  tax-planning.md        ← Quarterly tax notes

templates/
  new-client-intake.md   ← Comprehensive intake questionnaire
  meeting-prep.md        ← Pre-meeting brief template
  meeting-capture.md     ← Post-meeting documentation
  milestone-plan.md      ← Engagement/project milestone tracker
  stakeholder-map.md     ← Relationship intelligence template
  weekly-review.md       ← Guided review template

insights/
  patterns.md            ← Cross-client/project patterns
  methodology.md         ← User's approach (if provided)
```

### Starter System Adds:

```
pipeline/
  active.md
finances/
  overview.md
templates/
  meeting-capture.md
```

### Minimal System:
Just the standard `context/` and `people/` folders (no business modules).

## Setup Notes

### How Integrations Work

- **CLI tools** (gh, rclone) - Built-in, usually already installed
- **MCP servers** - Added to `.mcp.json`, restart Claude Code to activate
- **Browser assist** - I navigate web apps with you when no better option exists

### Adding New Integrations

Ask me about connecting any tool. I'll:
1. Search for the best available option
2. Explain what access it provides
3. Walk you through setup if you want it

1. **Create base folders** for the archetype
2. **Apply business depth modules** based on `business_depth` setting:
   - **Full:** Add pipeline/, accountability/, finances/, templates/, insights/ with all files
   - **Starter:** Add pipeline/active.md, finances/overview.md, templates/meeting-capture.md
   - **Minimal:** Skip business modules, just context/ and people/
3. **Copy templates** to appropriate locations
4. **Generate archetype-specific commands** (see archetype sections)
5. **Generate business commands** based on `business_depth`:
   - **Full:** Add `/pipeline-review`, `/financial-snapshot`, `/client-health`
   - **Starter:** Add `/pipeline-review`
   - **Minimal:** No additional business commands
6. **Create context/me.md** with user's profile data, including business preferences:
   ```markdown
   ## Business Setup
   - **Depth:** [full/starter/minimal]
   - **Tracks finances:** [yes/no]
   - **Billing model:** [if captured]
   - **Has methodology:** [yes/no]
   ```
7. **Initialize empty context files** (commitments, waiting, patterns, learnings)
8. **If has_methodology is true and business_depth is full:**
   - Create `insights/methodology.md` with user's notes as starting point
9. **If user expressed interest in integrations during Phase 3.5:**
   - Create `context/integrations.md`
   - Add integrations section to `context/me.md`
   - Note any specific integration interests for later
10. **Report what was created**, grouped by category:
    - Core files (context, people)
    - Business modules (if applicable)
    - Archetype-specific structure
    - Commands generated

## Handling Customization

If user requests modifications:
- Add requested folders
- Remove unwanted folders
- Rename as needed
- Always preserve core context/ structure
