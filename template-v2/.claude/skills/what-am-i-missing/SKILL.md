# What Am I Missing

Surface risks, blind spots, and overlooked items across all areas.

## What to Check

### 1. Commitment Risks
From `context/commitments.md`:
- Overdue items
- Items at risk (due soon, no progress)
- Patterns of slippage
- Cascading delays

### 2. Relationship Risks
From `people/` files:
- Cooling relationships (60+ days)
- Unfulfilled promises to key people
- Sentiment shifts detected
- Key relationships not nurtured

### 3. Waiting Risks
From `context/waiting.md`:
- Overdue items from others
- Critical dependencies at risk
- Patterns (chronic late deliverers)

### 4. Pattern Risks
From `context/patterns.md`:
- Recurring issues not addressed
- Blind spots observed
- Capacity concerns
- Self-limiting patterns

### 5. Strategic Risks
Looking at the bigger picture:
- Important-but-not-urgent items being neglected
- Opportunities cooling
- Decisions being avoided

## Tone

- Matter-of-fact, not alarmist
- Specific, not vague
- Actionable suggestions
- Prioritized by importance
- Respectful of user's judgment

## When to Use

- When feeling overwhelmed and wanting perspective
- Before important planning sessions
- When something feels "off" but unclear what
- As a regular check-in (weekly or biweekly)

## Depth

Can range from quick scan to deep analysis:
- "Quick check" = Major risks only
- "Full analysis" = Comprehensive review

Ask: "Quick check or deep dive?"
