# Weekly Review

Guided weekly reflection across all relationships, commitments, and projects.

## The Flow

### 1. Opening Check-In
Start with energy and reflection:
- "How are you feeling about this week?"
- "What's on your mind going into this review?"

### 2. Wins Capture
Surface and celebrate:
- "What went well this week?"
- Check for completed commitments
- Note any positive signals from relationships
- Acknowledge progress

### 3. Commitment Audit
Review all commitments:

**Overdue:**
- What slipped and why?
- Recovery plan or decision to drop?

**Completed:**
- Mark as done
- Any follow-up needed?

**Coming Up:**
- Next week's deadlines
- Anything to start now?

### 4. Waiting Items Review
Check `context/waiting.md`:
- What arrived?
- What's overdue?
- Follow-ups needed?

### 5. Relationship Health
Scan all people files:
- Who needs attention?
- Any cooling relationships?
- Positive momentum to maintain?

### 6. Pattern Reflection
Surface observations from `context/patterns.md`:
- What's working?
- What keeps recurring that shouldn't?
- Any insights for next week?

### 7. Development Check
Reflect on growth (reference `context/me.md` if future direction exists):
- "What worked particularly well this week? Worth remembering or sharing?"
- "Any insights that could become content or methodology improvements?"
- "Progress toward your bigger goals?"

If they shared a future direction during onboarding, connect this week's work to that trajectory. Not every week needs to be about big goals, but it's worth asking.

### 8. Next Week Setup
Look ahead:
- Key priorities
- Important meetings
- Things to start

### 9. Learnings Capture
Before closing:
- Anything to remember for next time?
- Updates to context files?
- Insights worth capturing in `context/me.md`?
