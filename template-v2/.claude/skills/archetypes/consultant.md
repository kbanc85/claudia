## Client Templates

Every `overview.md` here is an OKF knowledge file: frontmatter first, then the
body described below. Set `timestamp` (ISO 8601) on write. A client
`overview.md`:

```yaml
---
type: organization
title: "[Client Name]"
description: "[One line: the engagement]"
tags: [client, engagement]
timestamp: "[ISO 8601, now]"
---
```

A project `overview.md` uses `type: project`. See `docs/okf-conventions.md`.

### Full Business Depth: Per-Client Files

Each client folder (`clients/[client-name]/`) contains:

| File | Purpose | Key Fields |
|------|---------|------------|
| `overview.md` | Engagement snapshot | Status, phase, health (🟢/🟡/🔴), engagement type, value, primary contact, situation, success criteria, current focus, key relationships, commitments (ours + theirs) |
| `milestone-plan.md` | Phase-based milestone tracking | Phases with deliverable tables (deliverable, owner, due, status), check-in schedule, budget/hours |
| `stakeholders.md` | Relationship intelligence | Decision makers, influencers, day-to-day contacts with stance (Champion/Supporter/Neutral/Skeptic/Blocker), political landscape, strategy per stakeholder |
| `blockers.md` | Active blockers with resolution tracking | Status, impact, owner, root cause, resolution plan, escalation path (Day 3/7/14) |
| `decision-log.md` | Historical decisions | Decision, context, options considered, rationale, impact, pending decisions |
| `wins.md` | Successes for reviews/testimonials | What happened, impact, reusable for (case study, testimonial, proposal reference) |
| `meetings/` | Meeting notes folder | |
| `deliverables/` | Work product folder | |
| `documents/` | Ingested client docs | |

### Starter/Minimal: Simplified Client Overview
