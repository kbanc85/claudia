Claudia Memory System

A superhuman memory system for Claudia that:
- Never forgets (SQLite + sqlite-vec for permanent, vector-searchable storage)
- Runs 24/7 as a background daemon with scheduled consolidation
- Captures memories in real-time (crash-safe, survives terminal close)
- Provides proactive predictions and cross-references
