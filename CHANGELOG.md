# Changelog

All notable changes to Claudia will be documented in this file.

## 1.4.1 (2026-01-28)

### Fixed

- **spaCy crash on Python 3.14** - The entity extractor only caught `ImportError` when spaCy failed to load, but Python 3.14 triggers an internal `ConfigError` from Pydantic v1 instead. Broadened the exception handler so the daemon falls back to regex-based entity extraction gracefully instead of crashing on startup.

## 1.4.0 (2026-01-28)

### Per-Turn Memory Capture & Session Narratives

Claudia now captures every meaningful conversation turn and generates rich narrative summaries at session end. If a session ends abruptly, the next session catches up automatically.

### Added

- **Turn buffering** - `memory.buffer_turn` stores raw conversation turns without expensive embedding generation. Lightweight, crash-safe via SQLite WAL mode.
- **Session narratives** - `memory.end_session` lets Claude write a free-form narrative that enhances structured data with tone, emotional context, unresolved threads, reasons behind decisions, and half-formed ideas.
- **Orphan session catch-up** - `memory.unsummarized` detects sessions that ended without a summary. Next session start generates retroactive summaries from buffered turns.
- **Episode semantic search** - `recall_episodes()` searches session narratives by vector similarity, giving Claude access to the texture of past conversations.
- **Database migration system** - Version-tracked schema migrations in `database.py` so existing databases upgrade automatically.
- **Architecture documentation** - `ARCHITECTURE.md` with mermaid diagrams showing memory pipeline, data flow, and system components.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md** - Elevated memory system as core architecture alongside the template layer. Added development workflow for the memory daemon.
- **Memory manager skill** - Rewritten to use per-turn buffering instead of auto-remembering. Added detailed guidance on writing session narratives that enhance rather than compress information.
- **Session hooks** - Updated to include catch-up behavior at session start and narrative summarization at session end.
- **`recall_about()`** - Now includes recent session narratives mentioning the entity.

### Schema Changes

- `episodes` table: added `narrative`, `turn_count`, `is_summarized` columns
- New `turn_buffer` table for raw conversation turn storage
- New `episode_embeddings` virtual table for narrative semantic search
- Migration v2 applied automatically on existing databases

### Rollback

Tag `pre-memory-capture` on commit `834fb5e` (v1.3.2) provides a clean rollback point.

---

## 1.3.2 (2026-01-28)

### Fixed

- **MCP schema validation** - Moved `_comment` and `_comment2` out of `mcpServers` in `.mcp.json.example`. Claude Code's validator rejected these string values as invalid server definitions, causing parse errors when users renamed the file to `.mcp.json`.

---

## 1.3.1 (2026-01-28)

### Per-Project Memory Isolation

Each Claudia installation now gets its own isolated memory database, so memories from work projects don't mix with personal projects.

### Added

- **--project-dir argument** - Memory daemon accepts project directory for database isolation
- **Automatic isolation** - `.mcp.json.example` uses `${workspaceFolder}` to auto-isolate per project
- **Deterministic hashing** - Same project directory always maps to same database file

### How It Works

When Claude Code launches the MCP server, it passes the workspace folder. The daemon hashes the path to create a unique database:

```
~/.claudia/memory/
├── claudia.db          ← Global fallback (backward compatible)
├── a1b2c3d4.db         ← Project A's memories
├── e5f6g7h8.db         ← Project B's memories
```

### Backward Compatible

Existing installations without `--project-dir` continue using the global database.

## 1.3.0 (2026-01-28)

### Business Operating System

Claudia now generates business-grade folder structures for all archetypes, with depth that users choose during onboarding.

### Added

- **Business Depth Selection** - During onboarding, users choose between Full, Starter, or Minimal structure
- **Universal Business Modules** - Pipeline tracking, financial management, accountability, templates, and insights available to all archetypes
- **Deep Per-Client Structure** (Consultant) - Milestone plans, stakeholder maps, blockers, decision logs, wins documentation
- **Enhanced Archetypes** - All 5 archetypes upgraded with business depth variations
- **Structure Evolution Skill** - Claudia proactively suggests structural improvements as she observes your workflow
- **4 New Commands**:
  - `/pipeline-review` - Review active pipeline, deals, capacity
  - `/financial-snapshot` - Revenue, expenses, invoicing status
  - `/client-health` - Health check across all clients (Consultant/Solo)
  - `/accountability-check` - Surface commitments, overdue items, waiting-on

### Philosophy

Structure grows organically from actual needs. Users who want minimal setup get minimal setup. Power users get full business operating systems. Claudia watches for friction and offers targeted additions over time.

## 1.2.5 (2026-01-28)

### Memory System: Fully Automatic Installation

The memory system now works automatically after install with no manual intervention required.

### Fixed

- **sqlite-vec on Python 3.13+** - Now tries the Python package first before `enable_load_extension()`, which isn't available on Python 3.13
- **Ollama auto-start on macOS** - Creates LaunchAgent so Ollama starts on boot
- **Model pull reliability** - Ensures Ollama is running before attempting to pull the embedding model
- **Boot resilience** - Daemon waits up to 10 seconds for Ollama to start after reboot

### Added

- Comprehensive verification step at end of install showing status of all services
- 5 new checks in `diagnose.sh`: Ollama running, LaunchAgent configured, embedding model, sqlite-vec working
- Retry logic in embeddings service (5 attempts, 2s delay) for Ollama connection
